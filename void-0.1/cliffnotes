hmm, what about files or projects so small they are only a tiny file and
dont even have a project directory to sit in? 

I guess you'll have to make a dir for them, then put it in with the
corresponding VOIDINFO file next to it .. oh well

unless we can think of something, maybe bunching them into 'randomscripts'
project..hmm
