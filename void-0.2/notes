what is this piece of shit this time?

its about me being more bored than normal


I want something to manage my crap projects, in source code form.

so i'd have $HOME/dev as my project place as usual, but it would be a hardcoded environment
variable in a dotfile config or something, and the void script would manage
the repository, probably $HOME/dev, that would be full of TARBALLS only.

you'd never need to go in there yourself unless you want to have a look
but it would only be a load of tarballs anyway

you should use the checkout, list, checkin options to the void script in
order to check in and out of the repository, how are we to deal with
versioning control?

maybe a .void file in the same directory or VOID in your project dir, could
contain the name of the project, a little description, the version number
(what about individual version numbers on source modules), and what else?

hmm
